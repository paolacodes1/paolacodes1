# 👋 Hey, I'm Paola

**AI Builder | Web3 Explorer**



## 🧠 About Me

I'm a hands-on builder using **AI** and **automation** to craft tools that solve real-world problems—whether it's streamlining business tasks, enhancing communication, or simplifying workflows.  

Currently diving deep into:
- **AI-powered solutions**
- **Python scripting**
- **Web3 development**

I believe in building fast, learning by doing, and creating things that *actually* help people (or me at 2AM on a deadline).



## 🚧 What I'm Working On

🧩 **Personal Website**  
A dynamic portfolio built with Next.js + shadcn, showcasing projects, skills, and experiments.

🤖 **WhatsApp Bot for Hotels**  
A smart AI-powered bot that automates guest communication, handles inquiries, and assists with bookings in real-time.

🏨 **Hotel Booking System**  
A custom backend for local hotels to manage room availability, check-ins, and operations in one smooth dashboard.
