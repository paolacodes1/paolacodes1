👋 Hi, I'm Paola
AI Builder • Web3 Explorer • Automation Enthusiast
🧠 About Me
I’m a builder who learns by creating. Most of my projects start with a simple goal: make things easier, faster, and smarter. I enjoy using AI, automation, and code to solve real operational problems — from messy inboxes to manual workflows.
I’m currently exploring:
AI-powered automation
Python scripting
Web3 fundamentals
Practical workflows for real businesses
🚧 Current Projects
🤖 Work Automation Dashboard
A custom internal dashboard that automates my daily tasks: organizing emails, handling PDFs, generating reports, and keeping everything tidy with AI agents.
🏨 Hotel Management Dashboard + AI Assistant
A lightweight system for a local hotel to manage availability, check-ins, and daily operations. Includes an AI WhatsApp bot to answer guest questions and help with bookings.
🌳 Family Tree Website (Passion Project)
A personal project to turn my family’s history into an interactive, modern website — part archive, part storytelling, part experiment.
